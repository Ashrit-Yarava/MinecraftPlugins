> Minecraft Plugin to play the Death Swap game.

Plan

Command Outline:
- /deathswap addPlayer (playername)
- /deathswap start

Each tick, the plugin checks to make sure that the players are still alive.<br>
If a player has died, he is removed from the game. (Console message saying he has been removed.)<br>
When 5 minutes are up, players are randomly swapped.

TODO

- Change plugin to have start and stop compatibility.
